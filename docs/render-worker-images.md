# Render worker image deployment

The worker deployment boundary is intentionally split into two Render projects/environments:

| Purpose | Render project/environment | Services | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LaserStream-heavy monitors | `loyal-yield-laserstream-workers` / `production` | `loyal-kamino-reserve-monitor`, `loyal-balance-sweep-ata-monitor` | `ghcr.io/loyal-labs/loyal-yield-routing/laserstream-workers:sha-<commit>` |
| Lightweight SQL/background workers | `loyal-yield-light-workers` / `production` | `loyal-balance-sweep-ata-projector` | `ghcr.io/loyal-labs/loyal-yield-routing/light-workers:sha-<commit>` |

Current live pre-split Render state, observed with `render services -o json` on 2026-06-10:

| Object | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Current combined Render project `loyal` | `prj-d8hjcnojs32c73998uu0` |
| Current combined production environment `Production` | `evm-d8hjcnojs32c73998uv0` |
| Current `loyal-kamino-reserve-monitor` service | `srv-d8h4i9a8pkls73bver00` |
| Current `loyal-balance-sweep-ata-monitor` service | `srv-d8j87m6q1p3s73ff8n8g` |
| Current `loyal-balance-sweep-ata-projector` service | `srv-d8kfqpjbc2fs73chlc00` |

Target split IDs, once created/imported in Render, must be recorded here before the deploy is considered verified:

| Object | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Heavy Render project | `prj-d8kgt3a8qa3s7382glb0` |
| Heavy production environment | `evm-d8kgt3a8qa3s7382glc0` |
| Light Render project | `prj-d8kgt4r7uimc73b1ul0g` |
| Light production environment | `evm-d8kgt4r7uimc73b1ul1g` |

CI builds both images in `.github/workflows/worker-images.yml` and tags them as `sha-${GITHUB_SHA}`. Render services should use those immutable SHA tags or image digests. Do not use `latest` as the only service image reference.

Render's current Blueprint validator rejects `registryCredential` on these `runtime: image` worker services. Keep the GHCR images public, or attach any required private registry pull credentials in the Render Dashboard/API outside this Blueprint.

The monitor services deliberately remain separate Render services even though they share the same heavy image. They override the image command independently, so a restart, deploy, or failure of one monitor does not share a runtime process with the other.
